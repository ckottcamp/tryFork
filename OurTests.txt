To create our FileLoadTests class, we modeled the same format the CR did in order to ensure we were developing our game in the same standardized way so that trading code will not become an issue later. We have the same sized board with the same amount of rooms, so testing for those attributes was not something we changed. To test that the legend was loaded correctly, we made sure each char we have assigned in the .txt file matches up with its corresponding string name for every room. Testing for every room was probably unnecessary but we thought it was a good idea to at least make sure we test the first and last rooms in the legend.txt file as well as make sure the rooms that had a space in their string name were correct. To test the door directions, we went about our map and chose one door for each direction to test. Many rooms have several doors in different directions but we chose 4 doors in different directions from different rooms to test. We also thought it was important to test that room pieces and walkway pieces were NOT doors so we randomly chose a few of those to test throughout out board that we know are not doors. We actually ended up having the same number of doors total that CR had so our method to test that was exactly the same, purely coincidence, but we basically just iterate over the entire board and count the number of door cells. We then decided to test one cell from each room that was not a doorway to ensure that the correct char initial was assigned to it. We then decide to choose to cells from rooms that were doors also had the correct char initial to ensure those cells with the two char string for cell abbreviation in the .csv file were imported correctly.
