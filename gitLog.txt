# NOTE TO GRADER: We did some pair programming. Also, Bane did a lot more intermediate commits. It appears as though Bane made far more contributions in the log, but Bane just has a habit of commit-ing with comments on a lot of intermediate things that are probably unnecessary. We both contributed to the project evenly, even though the log does not reflect that.

    so we were testing to make sure targets would not include ANY doors if the current cell was a door. I changed this so that if the current cell is a door, then no doors for that same room will be added as targets

Author: Max Watson <mawatson@mymail.mines.edu>
Date:   Tue Oct 11 22:10:11 2016 -0600

    Fixed final two tests. Error was in the our calcTargets function; the starting cell was not being added to the visited list initially, and this caused the issue of certain door targets not being included in the target list. Both sets of test now pass and the code should be ready for submission.

Date:   Tue Oct 11 21:40:53 2016 -0600

    Added some more fixes. Moved the code to remove doors from the room just exited to a higher level of function call. Six steps and Five steps are still failing when run in the file but passing individually. Continuing to debug.

    Added statements to calcTarg to remove any door adjacent to the departure cell, if the departure cell is a door itself. This prevents the player from entering a room they just left through another door

    Continued to debug failing tests. Discovered some errors with there not being enough assertEquals statements in the test file. Also debugging an error where a test passes when run indivudally but not when the whole file is run. Also debugging errors with entering the room that was exited through another door.

    Within the loadBoardConfig function, the wrong thing was being tested to throw the BadConfigFileException which just threw it regardless.

    fixed weird error that caused tests to fail. Had to do with testing car vs other and ignoring the case. Not ignoring the case caused the program to abort this the tests would fail. There is still a stack trace printed from the BadConfigException which appear tos be thrown at the end of the legend import function. Likely it is taking in the last blank line and if satisfies the if statement which throws an exception.
